  - From the Home Page, a user must login using their google credentials to access the app. 
 2) ### Task Page 
  - Once authenticated, a user can navigate via the navigation bar o 1) tasks, 2) Goals or 3) Journal
  - The user can enter the name of the specific task with in the "Add Tasks" form along with the date the task schoule be completed, and the category of the task. 
  - Catergories included are as follows: 
    - Work   
    - Health
    - Fitness
    - Household
    - Travel
    - Shopping

   - After the task is entered, and the user clicks "add task" the newly created task will be displayed on the screen. 
   - Additionally, a countdown feature that displays the number of days remianing to complete the task is automatically added to the display. 
  3) ### Goals Page 
   - The goals page is similiar to the task page in functionality with one key difference; The goals page allows a user to create a "goal" and once created, provides the user with a link to access a goals "journal". 

  4) ### Show Page 
   - A user can add a "note" to any goal, (every goal once created turns into a link that allows a user to click on it to add the "note")
   - From there, a user can add any aditional text informarion pertaining to a specific goal. 
    
  5) ### Journal Page
   - The journal page displays all the "notes" of any particular goal.
